# Demo Explanation

This program is intended to explore the equations that go into determining a
CVSS score. In order to keep things simple for a clearer display, I went with
randomizing the elements instead of requesting input from a user, while also
demonstrating the role of each value.

## Dependencies

You must have Java/its compiler set up in your working environment.
