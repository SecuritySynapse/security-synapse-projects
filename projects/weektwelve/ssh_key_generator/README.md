# SSH Key Generator

This is a simple tool used to generate public and private SSH keys.
This is done by tuilizing the RSA asymmetric encryption algorithm
imported from the Paramiko library. From there the keys are saved
to the memory and then printed out to the user terminal.

## Instructions

You must install paramiko using pip in order for this to run.

The script to generate SSH keys can be ran by running "python3 ssh_generator.py".
