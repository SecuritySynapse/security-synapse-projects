# Week 5 - Malware

## C

This is a simulation of a ransomware attack, as creating actual ransomware
would be unethical. It can only interact with the files it has been given.

The `src/backup` folder contains the originals of these files as well.

Requires C and a gcc compiler to complete these instructions; may require
a VSCode C/C++ extension if run there.

In the `src` folder, if it is not yet compiled, compile `main.c` with this command:

- `gcc main.c -o main.out`

Then run the program with the command:

- `./main.out`

This should result in the following output.

```text

```
